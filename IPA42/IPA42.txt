Create a class Person with the following attributes:

firstName - String
lastName - String
age - int
gender - char ('M' for male and 'F' for female)

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create a class Student that extends the Person class and adds the following attributes:

rollNo - String
course - String
semester - int
GPA - double

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create a class Faculty that extends the Person class and adds the following attributes:

employeeId - String
department - String
designation - String
salary - double

Write getters, setters and parameterized constructor in the above mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create a class Solution with the main method.

Implement two static methods - findHighestGPAStudent and findHighestPaidFaculty in Solution class.

findHighestGPAStudent method:
This method will take an array of Student objects as input.
The method will return the Student object with the highest GPA.
If the array is empty, the method should return null.

findHighestPaidFaculty method:
This method will take an array of Faculty objects as input.
The method will return the Faculty object with the highest salary.
If the array is empty, the method should return null.

These above mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For findHighestGPAStudent method - The main method should print the roll number, course and GPA of the returned Student object.
If the returned value is null then it should print "Sorry - No student is available".

For findHighestPaidFaculty method - The main method should print the employee ID, department and salary of the returned 
Faculty object.
If the returned value is null then it should print "Sorry - No faculty is available".

Before calling these static methods in main, use Scanner object to read the values of two Student objects and two Faculty 
objects referring attributes in the above mentioned attribute sequence.
