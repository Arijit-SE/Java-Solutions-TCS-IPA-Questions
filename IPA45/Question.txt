Create a class Employee with the following attributes:

name (string)
age (int)
salary (double)
Write getters, setters, and a parameterized constructor in the above-mentioned attribute sequence as required.

Create a class Solution with the main method.

Implement two static methods - calculateYearlySalary and calculateTax in the Solution class.

calculateYearlySalary method:
-----------------------------------------
This method will take an Employee object as input.
The method will calculate the yearly salary of the employee (assuming that the employee works for 12 months in a year) and 
return it as a double.

calculateTax method:
-----------------------------------------
This method will take an Employee object as input.
The method will calculate the tax to be paid by the employee based on the following rules:

If the yearly salary is less than or equal to 50000, the tax is 10% of the yearly salary.
If the yearly salary is greater than 50000 but less than or equal to 100000, the tax is 20% of the amount over 50000 plus 10% 
of the first 50000.
If the yearly salary is greater than 100000, the tax is 30% of the amount over 100000 plus 20% of the amount between 50000 and 
100000 plus 10% of the first 50000.
The method will return the tax amount as a double.
These above-mentioned static methods should be called from the main method.

For calculateYearlySalary method - The main method should print the yearly salary returned by the method.

For calculateTax method - The main method should print the tax amount returned by the method.

Before calling these static methods in main, use a Scanner object to read the values of an Employee object's attributes.

Example Input:
----------------
John
30
55000.0

Example Output:
----------------
Yearly salary of John: 660000.0
Tax to be paid by John: 183000.0
