Create a class named "Employee" with the following attributes:

id (int)
name (String)
designation (String)
salary (double)

The above attributes should be private, and the class should have a parameterized constructor to initialize them.

Implement the following methods in the Employee class:

getSalary(): This method should return the salary of the employee.
getDesignation(): This method should return the designation of the employee.

Create a class named "Company" with the following attributes:

companyName (String)
employees (Employee array)
numEmployees (int)

The above attributes should be private, and the class should have a parameterized constructor to initialize them.

Implement the following methods in the Company class:

getAverageSalary(): This method should return the average salary of all the employees in the company.
getMaxSalary(): This method should return the highest salary of all the employees in the company.
getEmployeesByDesignation(String designation): This method should return an array of all employees with the given designation.

In the main method, use a Scanner object to read the values of the company name, number of employees, and the employee details 
(id, name, designation, and salary) in a loop. Once all employee details have been read, create a Company object and pass the 
appropriate parameters. Finally, call the three methods mentioned above and print the output.

Note:

All searches should be case-insensitive.
You may assume that the input is valid and in the correct format.

Sample input:
