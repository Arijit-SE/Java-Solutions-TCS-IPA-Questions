Create a class Music with below attributes:

playListNo - int

type -String

count - int

duration(minutes) -double.



The above attributes should be private.Write Getter and Setter and 

parametrized constructor as required.

Create class Solution with main method.

****************************************************************************

Implement two static methods: findAvgOfCount and sortTypeByDuration in 

Solution Class.



findAvgOfCount Method:

This method will take an array of Music objects and an int value as input

parameters.The method will find out Average (as int) of count for those 


objects whose count is more than the given Count(int parameter passed).This 


method will return average if found.If there is no Type that matches then 

the method should return 0.



for this method- main method should print average ,if the returned value

is not 0.If the returned value is 0 then main method should print 

"No playlist found".



sortTypeByDuration method:

This method will take an array of Music objects and an int value as input 

parameters.This method should return an array of Music objects in an 


ascending order of their duration which are more than the given duration

(int parameter passed) value.

If there are no such objects ,then the method should return null.



for this method-The main method should print the type from the returned

Music object array if the returned value is not null.If the returned value 

is null then the main method should print "No playlist found with 

mentioned attribute".
